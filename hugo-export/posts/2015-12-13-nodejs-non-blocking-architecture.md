  JavaScript is a dynamic, object-oriented, and functional scripting language. One of the features that make it win over Java Applets in the browser scripting war decades ago, it was its lightness and non-blocking event loop.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bocking means that when one line of code is executing the rest of it is locked waiting to finish. On the other hand, non-blocking gives to each line of code a shot and then through callbacks it can come back when an event happens. Programming languages that are blocking (Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, â€¦) overcomes concurrency using multiple threads of execution while JavaScript handles it using non-blocking event loop in a single thread.

  Some companies like <a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2013/11/22/node-js-at-paypal/">Paypal</a> moved from Java backend to NodeJS and reported a increased performance, lower average response times, and development speed gains. Similarly happens to <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/misc/i-tier-dismantling-the-monoliths/">Groupon</a> that came from Java/Rails monoliths.
