JavaScript is a cross platform, object oriented scripting language. It is the most popular programming language used on the web.

Characteristics:

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Order of Execution</strong>: Scripts are executed as encountered in the flow of the page. Although JavaScript may appear anywhere in a page, it&#8217;s best to place function definitions within the element.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Case Sensitivity</strong>: JavaScript is case-sensitive; myvar and MyVar are different variables in JavaScript. This applies to all aspects of the language, including keywords, operators, variable names, event handlers, and object names. All keywords are lowercase.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong> Conventions for naming variables:</strong> JavaScript uses a &#8220;camel-back&#8221; naming convention, in which methods or properties use mixed casing, e.g., lastModified property of the Document object, in which the M of lastModified must be uppercase. Because HTML requires lowercase element and attribute names, favor lowercase in JavaScript as well.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Whitespace:</strong> JavaScript ignores excess (i.e., more than 1) whitespace, as does HTML. Statements: Assignment statements use the equal sign, assigning the expression of the right side to the variable of the left. All statements must end with a semicolon. More than one statement may be included on a line, each statement ending in a semicolon. Semicolons may be eliminated if statements are separated by a line-break, but relying on this is bad practice: use the semicolon!
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Blocks:</strong> Groups of more than one statement may be included in { } curly brackets; do this for the body of functions, for blocks of code within loops, etc.
</li>

    <strong>Variables:</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In JavaScript, there are three primary data types, two composite data types, and two special data types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The primary (primitive) data types are:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      String
    </li>
    <li>
      Number
    </li>
    <li>
      Boolean
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The composite (reference) data types are:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Object
    </li>
    <li>
      Array
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The special data types are:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Null
    </li>
    <li>
      Undefined
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
